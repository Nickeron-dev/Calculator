# Calculator
This is not simple calculator. It writes everything in a file. The reason of it is chemistry. Our teacher asks us about our solutions(at least how did we count). That's why I decided to create a calculator that adds countings into a file and then print this file after doing homework:))

                                                       How to use
1. You can input values with keyboard or with buttons.
2. Counting is like in normal calculator.
3. To clear everything from the main textfield press "C".
4. To remove only one last symbol press "←".
5. If checkbox at the bottom is ticked, calculator adds values and solution to the text file "countings.txt".
6. You can untick the checkbox if you don't need writing to file.
7. There is a textfield at the bottom. If you write something there and press "submit" button, it will add your text in "countings.txt".
8. π symbol works a PI in math.
